          I am a 4th-year student in Bachelor of Science in Information
          Technology at Mabalacat City College, with a focus on web development.
          Throughout my studies, I have gained practical experience by building
          real-world applications, such as a comprehensive dental management
          system for Tooth Impressionâ€™s Dental Clinic.

        <h1 className="text-l max-w-xl text-right my-4">
          I am skilled in front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML5,
          CSS3, JavaScript, ReactJS, Laravel, and Tailwind CSS. My
          certifications in JavaScript, Python, and networking further
          complement my technical foundation. As I look for opportunities, I aim
